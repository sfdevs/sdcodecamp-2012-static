The goal of this paper is re-introducing all of these standard common controls used for developing Graphic User Interface or (GUI) in different shapes with full functionality. This will offer a good opportunity for the novice programmers to use these modified common controls to build professional and more understandable windows applications. The modification can be made by changing the common control shape completely, replace it with a bitmap, integrate it with another icon, changing the font and the color of the text, and/or combine two or more of these common controls together into one control. Each modified control has its one class. Each class is inherited from the main class of that control. Any novice programmer can use any of these classes and add it to his or her own project to modify and enhance the visually of the windows application. The modification was done by using one of the emerging media tools such as VC++ MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) library or VC++ Win32 API SDK.
